# Space Invaders

A UNIFI project for the programming exam

## THE GAME
Space Invaders is a fixed-screen arcade shoot 'em up video game from 1978, featuring an alien invasion theme, developed by Tomohiro Nishikado.
It has been revisited by adding some small modifications, such as power-ups and achievements.

## Game Modes

The player controls a movable cannon that moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen and must shoot down the aliens one by one as they slowly approach Earth. The stages of alien approach to the World follow a unique pattern, a wide and orderly zigzag that slowly but inevitably brings them to reach the bottom of the screen, signifying the invasion has taken place and the game is over.

The player defends Earth by facing hordes of aliens that continuously descend (as soon as one wave is exterminated, another descends, faster and more aggressive). Occasionally, "Mystery Ships" scroll across the top of the screen, which are bonus spacecraft that, if shot down, allow the player to increase their score much faster and drop power-ups that can be collected by the player. The game ends when the aliens reach the bottom of the screen or when the cannon is destroyed multiple times.

The cannon can be destroyed by deadly rays periodically launched by the aliens towards the cannon. The cannon is partially protected by immobile defensive bunkers that are gradually destroyed by the alien projectiles or shots fired by the player. The player has three movable cannons (three base lives), and once they are destroyed, the game ends.

The player has an unlimited number of projectiles. As the aliens are destroyed, the remaining ones move faster on the screen. The increase in speed is accompanied by an accelerated background sound, resembling a heartbeat, which becomes increasingly intense. If considered as musical accompaniment, it historically represents the first video game with a "soundtrack" during gameplay.
